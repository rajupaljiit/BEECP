BEECP: Biogeography optimization-based energy efficient clustering protocol for HWSNs 


Energy saving is the prominent requirement of wireless sensor networks implemented in harsh environments. This paper examines the diminution of energy utilization of wireless sensor networks using efficient cluster head election with a novel clustering protocol inspired by biogeography-based optimization. Simulation results show that the proposed method prolongs the overall network lifetime and stability period as compared to other evolutionary-based clustering protocols like stable election protocol (SEP), evolutionary routing protocol (ERP), and intelligent hierarchical clustering routing (IHCR).
